Just play with chatGPT to save my coding effort

## cacheXHR
I want to write a script to save the performance of some poorly written ajax website

use ChatGPT to generate the 1st version, not work, so I ask it to generate the test.html and server.py for testing, and write the version 2 by stackoverflow and myself.
